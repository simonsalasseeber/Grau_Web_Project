**Project title**: Grau music

**Description**: 

With so many highs and lows, I can proudly share this finalized project. Struggling to decide what to make for the final project of this majestuous course, a musician friend of mine told me that he wanted to publish his works on a webpage. Knowing little about
web development but in the process of becoming a developer, I decided to leverage the skills learned in cs50 with the ones adquired in the "SoyHenry" Bootcamp, and accepted the challenge.

**The project has the following structure**:

**Front-End**: here we have the node_modules dependencies and the classical "src" folder with the real "juice" of the matter. Following modularization best practices, I divided the structure in components, views and assets. In the components its were the logic is concentrated, creating the navigation bars, the Cards and the Card that every react developer can relate to, and in the views, as its name indicates, we have the UI. In the assets we have the typos that my friend wanted to apply to the written words of the project, and also the images of the logos and vectors.

**Back-End**: here we also have the node_modules and the src folder. Several designs were possible inside it, but given the relative simplicity of the project, I focused on a functional approach that separates and creates an
specific folder for the controllers, for the routes, for the middlewares, for the utils, for the models, for the services and for the assets. Sensible variables were stored in an external .env file, following best practices standards. Test were also included, to guarantee the correct functionality of the system.

**Biggest challenge**: If I had to pick the biggest challenge of the project, was to set up the Admin server. My friend wants to use this page forever, and he needs to upload his new projects, delete the old, and select one for the "Main" section. At first I only thought: "How on earth I'm going to code a functionality that a) receives an image, a video URL, a title and a producer b) takes all that and uploads it to the web (permanently) c) been able to delete and add 'a piacere' d) encoded for the admin only". Thanks to internet resources, combined with lots of patience and dedication, I now firmly believe that everything is possible.

**The project is built with the following technologies:

**Frontend**:

Vite (build tool for modern web applications)
React (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
HTML (markup language for creating web pages)
CSS (style sheet language for styling web pages)

**Backend**:

Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development)
Express (web application framework for Node.js)
Mongoose (Object Data Modeling library for MongoDB and Node.js)
Bcrypt (library for hashing passwords securely)

**Cloud Services**:

Cloudinary (cloud-based image and video management service)


**Final notes**: David, Brian and Doug, I really appreciate what you do, it has certainly changed my life. Can't believe cs50 is free. God bless the internet, the education and the passion for learning!

I'm really grateful for the opportunity get educated for free at such a high level, an opportunity that this internet world has made possible. David, if you read this, I truly appreciate
 what you do, and Im forever in debt with this course. Certainly, I extend the thank you to Brian and Doug, whose help has been invaluable for me.
